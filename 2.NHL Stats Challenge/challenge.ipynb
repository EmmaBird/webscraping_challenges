You can find the code for the guide in this [Deepnote Project](https://deepnote.com/project/0d7f30b4-7eb4-4d7e-b601-28085e59e0d3#%2F1.OpenAPI.ipynb).\n\n#### The challenge is to simply scrape the **Skaters Stats Table** with stats from the [**combined 18/19 and 19/20 season playoffs**](http://www.nhl.com/stats/skaters?reportType=season&seasonFrom=20182019&seasonTo=20192020&gameType=3&filter=gamesPlayed,gte,1&sort=points,goals,assists&page=0&pageSize=50).\n1. ##### **Start** by ***using the Network Tool*** on your ```browser``` to identify any possible requests for the data in the table.\n\n2. ##### **Copy** and **Paste** the ***request url*** into a new tab on your **browser** to see if you can access the API without the actual website.\n\n3. ##### **Make call(s)** for the relevant data via [`requests`.](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/)\n\n4. ##### **Create** a Pandas **Dataframe** containing the **data**.\n\n5. ##### **Make sure you have ALL the data**. You'll notice that the table has a total of **583 records**. Does yours?\n\n    **Hint:** The table is **paginated**, and **so is the API**. Pay attention to the **Request URL Parameters**. Have a play around with the **values** given to the **`page`** and **`pageSize`** parameters.\n\n\n6. ##### **Save** the Dataframe to a new **CSV** file within the `data` folder.\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"output_cleared":false,"cell_id":"00000-844e0a68-d76e-4d9a-b442-5dff1a5499c2","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"output_cleared":false,"source_hash":"becacfbd","execution_millis":1,"cell_id":"00001-514f9a9f-baeb-49fc-ac7b-4900b64a3dbb","execution_start":1608311737372,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"import requests","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.3"},"deepnote_notebook_id":"eb0afcfd-56b3-4774-8096-d40ffa61b2ee","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
