It's a good idea to genereate different keys for different projects).\n5. ##### In your projects [Environment Variables](https://docs.deepnote.com/environment/environment-variables), add an Evironmental Variable called `STORMGLASS_KEY` and paste in your API Key as the value.\n\nNow we'll beable to access out 'sensitive' key without having to hard code it like so:","metadata":{"tags":[],"output_cleared":false,"cell_id":"00000-e3ccb74d-0d51-46ca-bfd0-692951410868","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"output_cleared":true,"source_hash":null,"execution_millis":2,"cell_id":"00001-cd74c3f0-1a43-48f8-92d5-94d20993a679","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"execution_start":1610028940535,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"import os\n\nos.environ[\"STORMGLASS_KEY\"]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### The Challenge\n\n> For this challenge, we want to collate all the relevent data for Olympic Level Sailing. To keep it 100, we'll be looking at data from `Enoshima Yacht Harbour` (Sailing location for Tokyo Olympics).\n\n1. ##### [Find the latitute and longitude](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/18539?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en&oco=0) of `Enoshima Yacht Harbour`.   \n\n    **Note**: To get marine data you need to include a coordinate at ***sea*** in your request, and to get data for land and lakes - simply send in a coordinate located on land or on a lake. So..make sure your coordinates are in the sea nearby!\n\n2. ##### Consult the [Storm Glass Documentation](https://docs.stormglass.io/#/weather) to make a call to the `Weather` endpoint.\n\n2. ##### Select params you feel will be relevatn to Olympic Level Sailing. Filter out Weather data between (06:00-18:00) of a single day in the future.\n\n    **Note**: The `time` data is return in UTC, to truely get the data from a single day (between the specified time), we'll neeed to work out the local time from the UTC time e.g. Japand Standard Time is UTC+9...\n\n3. ##### You'll notice that the data contains values from several weather stations. **Mean** these values to form a single value for each field. \n4. ##### Create a Pandas dataframe from the data.\n\n    **Note**: **You are LIMITED to 50 request a day on a free account.** A good idea is to save the response from an API call into your own JSON file and work with that data whilst developing your proecssing solution.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00002-a82931c0-3168-4b8e-8a40-f1f67ca12b3e","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00003-e50ab77a-68b1-4d88-99a3-b38de6eb2c3e","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"source_hash":"ef8a7ac3","execution_millis":0,"execution_start":1610029592527,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"location = 'Enoshima Yacht Harbour'\nlat = None\nlng = None","outputs":[],"execution_count":null}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.3"},"deepnote_notebook_id":"463203e2-a1f4-40cf-a00e-083a36bf5d87","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
